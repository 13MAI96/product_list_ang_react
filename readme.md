# Tecnical test 23/10/25

## Assumptions and definitions

### About the data obtained from the api
There is one request to obtain the list each time a user navigate to the home screen. With this data, any filter is applied locally, updating the items displayed but without changing the original list. 

### Use of libraries
No advanced store management is required, so no libraries were implemented for this funcionality.
As for style libraries, the project requirements do not require complex styles, so I considered implementing them directly with CSS.

### Designs and functionalities
No specific designs were defined, so I implemented designs according my criteria with the aim of providing a good visual presentation.
A button was added on product page to navigate to the home screen, adding navigability and usefulness to this project.

Tooltips to cacth errors?
Spinners for loading?

### Components
Reusable components were created only for cases where reuse was required, such as CARD and STAR. These components have their own defined styles and receive specific data depending on the circumstances and requirements.
